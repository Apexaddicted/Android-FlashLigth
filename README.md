# Android-FlashLigth
An Android flashlight without extra permissions. Works with phones without flash (change brightness of the screen)

##Why I made this:
-I've seen so many apps that require to much permissions to work, and that's because they are gathering information about us, so I've decided I want to reduce that risk

-To learn more things about Android

-To have the chance to personalize my app


##Instructions:
This app work on phones with and without flash, so obviously when the device doesn't have flash the app will turn the screen brightness to it's maximum.

####-If you have a flash:

  -You can turn on and off the flash (when you pause or stop the application it'll turn off)
  
  -You can turn your screen brightness to it's maximum. (It'll glow so hard you'll became a photosynthetic human being)
  
####-If you DON'T have a flash:
  
  -You can turn your screen brightness to it's maximum. (It'll glow so hard you'll became a photosynthetic human being)


##Notes:

When you choose the option to became a photosynthetic human being you can click the power button to turn the screen off and on, even if you have a lock screen.



##To Do:

-Make it smaller

-Make it work in a single activity


##Known Problems:

-If you have your screen brigthness to adapt automatically, it won't work properly
